# Problem Statement :
The data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade was provided to us, along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this assignment, we tried to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.

# Important Points to remember while solving the Assignment :
- The commands are syntactically correct.
- The output of the code is correct in terms of the question and format.
- The data frame has been thoroughly inspected using the taught commands.
- In the case of dataframes, the results contain the same rows and columns as expected
- Regarding plots, making appropriate charts with the mentioned libraries and getting the right trends.Writing clear and concise inferences for the charts wherever asked.
- The code is concise. Wherever appropriate, built-in functions are used instead of making the code longer (if-else statements, for loops,loc/iloc ).
- If new variables are created, the names are descriptive and unambiguous. Following the variable/dataframe names mentioned in the question wherever it is provided.
- Charts are neatly formatted including proper chart sizes, annotations(if required) and labelling.
